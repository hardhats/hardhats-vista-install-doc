<h1 id="purpose-of-this-tutorial">Purpose of this Tutorial</h1>
<p>This tutorial will help you set-up both outgoing and incoming connections to HL7 in VistA via <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transmission_Control_Protocol">TCP</a> only. The tutorial will be very thin on theoretical content on HL7 itself. For a fuller treatment of the subject matter, consult the manuals in the <a href="https://www.va.gov/vdl/application.asp?appid=8">VistA Documentation Library</a>, in particular, <a href="https://www.va.gov/vdl/documents/Infrastructure/Health_Level_7_(HL7)/hl71_6p56_p66.pdf">this manual</a>. There is a newer HL7 messaging system in VistA called &quot;HL7 Optimized (HLO)&quot; --we wont be discussing that here as HLO is not widely used.</p>
<h1 id="what-is-hl7">What is HL7?</h1>
<p>HL7 means Health Level 7, the number 7 corresponding to the Application Layer in the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OSI_model">OSI Model</a>. In brief, it is a messaging format used in Medicine. It's important because when deploying VistA in a healthcare setting, you almost always have to talk to other machines, such a lab instruments, ECG/EKG instruments, X-ray machines, and the list goes on forever. The way to talk to all of these instruments is using HL7.</p>
<p>When we speak of HL7 in this document, we specifically mean HL7 versions 2.1, 2.2, 2.3, and 2.4, which are all similar to each other. We will not talk about HL7 v3 and later, which include CDA documents and the like as these are not used for interfacing with Medical Devices.</p>
<h1 id="what-is-an-hl7-message">What is an HL7 message?</h1>
<p>The following description is taken from <a href="https://www.va.gov/vdl/documents/Infrastructure/Health_Level_7_(HL7)/hl71_6p56_p66.pdf">this manual</a>.</p>
<p>An HL7 message is the atomic unit for transfe rring data between systems in the HL7 standard. Each message has a header segment composed of a number of fields, including a field containing the message type and (HL7 versions 2.2 and a bove) event type. These are each three-character codes, defined by the HL7 standard. The type of a transaction is defined by the message type/event type pair (again for HL7 versions 2.2 and above). Rules for constructing message headers and messages are provided in the &quot;Control/Query&quot; chapter of the HL7 standard.</p>
<p>An HL7 message consists of one or more HL7 segments . A segment is similar to a record in a file. Each segment consists of one or more fi elds separated by a special character called the field separator . The field separator character is defined in the Message Header (MSH) segment of an HL7 message. The MSH segment is always the first segment in every HL7 message (except for batch HL7 messages, which begin with BHS or FHS segments).</p>
<p>In addition to the field separator character, four other special characters, called encoding characters, are used as delimiters. Encoding characters are also defined in the MSH segment. Each encoding character must be unique, and serves a specific purpose. None of the encoding characters can be the same as the field separator character. The four delimiters for which there are encoding characters are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Component separator. Some data fields can be divided into multiple components. The component separator character separates adjacent components within a data field.</li>
<li>Repetition separator. Some data fields can be repeated multiple times in a segment. The repetition separator character separates multiple occurrences of a field.</li>
<li>Escape character. Data fields defined as text or formatted text can include escape sequences. The escape character separates escape sequences from the actual text.</li>
<li>Sub-component separator. Some data fields can be divided into components, and each component can be further divided into sub-components. The sub-component separator character separates adjacent sub-components within a component of a field.</li>
</ul>
<p>Here's an example of an HL7 message:</p>
<pre><code>MSH|^~\&amp;|INFOLIO TEST|BOSTON VAMC|IB TEST|500|19900314130405|ORU^R01|523123|D|2.3|

OBX|ST|VB^BLOOD PRESSURE^L||120/80|MM HG
OBX|ST|VT^TEMPERATURE^L||99|C
OBX|ST|VP^PULSE^L||75|/MIN </code></pre>
<ul>
<li>The first line of the message is the message header (MSH) segment
<ul>
<li>The field separator is ‘|’, the component separator is ‘^’, the repetition separator is ‘~’, the escape character is ‘’ and the subcomponent separator is ‘&amp;’. This is the recommended set.</li>
<li>The sending application is INFOLIO TEST and the receiving application is IBTEST.</li>
<li>The sending facility is BOSTON VAMC and the receiving facility is 500.</li>
<li>The message type is Observation Result/Unsolicited (ORU) and the event type is an unsolicited transmission of an observation message (R01).</li>
</ul></li>
<li>The message type (from the MSH segment) is Observation Result/Unsolicited (ORU)</li>
<li>The second line of the message is the second segment, Patient Identification (PID)</li>
<li>The third line of the message is the third segment, an Observation Request (OBR)</li>
<li>The subsequent lines of the message are multiple observation/results (OBX) segments</li>
</ul>
<p>Most HL7 messages are unsolicited. They are sent to VistA; or VistA sends them; without either party knowing beforehand that they are getting a message.</p>
<p>HL7 messages typically require an acknowledgement message to be sent. A sample acknowledgement looks like this:</p>
<pre><code>MSH|^~\&amp;|CATH|StJohn|AcmeHIS|StJohn|20061019172719||ACK^O01|MSGID12349876|P|2.3
MSA|AA|MSGID12349876</code></pre>
<p>The second piece of the MSA segement is either:</p>
<ul>
<li>AA – Application Accept</li>
<li>AE – Application Error</li>
<li>AR – Application Reject</li>
</ul>
<p>There is one more thing that's important to mention: The messages above are just the contents. The actual message transmitted over TCP contains several control characters to delimit the start and the end of the message. (TCP is a stream protocol; so you must provide either message lengths or delimiters to deliniate the beginning and end of a message). This is called the HL7 Minimal Lower Layer Protocol (MLLP). So a full HL7 message over TCP looks like this:</p>
<pre><code>&lt;ASCII VERTICAL TAB - $C(11)/0X0B&gt;
HL7 MESSAGE
&lt;ASCII FILE SEPARATOR - $C(28)/0X1C&gt;
&lt;ASCII CARRIAGE RETURN - $C(13)/0X0D&gt;</code></pre>
<h1 id="hl7-system-startup">HL7 System Startup</h1>
<p>There are some persistent taskman tasks that need to be created in order for the HL7 system to initialize itself. The tasks are <code>HL AUTOSTART LINK MANAGER</code> and <code>HL TASK RESTART</code>, which need to be set to start-up persistent. On a production system, you must schedule <code>HL PURGE TRANSMISSIONS</code> nightly to ensure that you don't run out of disk space.</p>
<p>To schedule these tasks, go to <a href="./InitializeVistA.html#back-to-taskman">this section</a> of the Intialize VistA document. Remember, two of the tasks are to be marked as Startup Persistent, and one is recurring every night.</p>

<h1 id="hl7-send-setup">HL7 Send Setup</h1>
<p>What I will show here is a typical scenario of sending messages out to other systems. VistA sends messages at specific events (the messages sent and the event at which a message is sent is typically documented in the technical manual for a package on the <a href="https://www.va.gov/vdl">VDL</a>). The event is something that happens inside of VistA, such as the registration of a patient, the availability of lab results, or the scheduling of an appointment. The example we will use is patient registration, upon which VistA can send an HL7 ADT/A04 message, which is a patient registration message.</p>
<h2 id="introduction-to-outgoing-message-routing-in-vista">Introduction to Outgoing Message Routing in VistA</h2>
<p>This part is confusing, mainly because the way an outgoing message is processed is almost identical to how an incoming message is processed. So we will discuss this again in the context of incoming messages.</p>
<p>To send an outgoing message from VistA, you need to create an EVENT DRIVER protocol (it actually lives in a file called PROTOCOL in Fileman). The EVENT DRIVER is also known as a SERVER (which I personally find confusing, but oh well). Here's the one we will use: (NB: to reach this form, you need to navigate to EVE &gt; HL7 Main Menu &gt; Interface Developer Options &gt; Protocol Edit and select <code>VAFC ADT-A04 SERVER</code>.)</p>
<pre><code>|                        HL7 INTERFACE SETUP                         PAGE 1 OF 2
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

            NAME: VAFC ADT-A04 SERVER

DESCRIPTION (wp): + [This server protocol fires when a patient is re]


ENTRY ACTION:

 EXIT ACTION:


        TYPE: event driver



_______________________________________________________________________________

Exit    Save    Refresh    Quit</code></pre>
<p>On the second page of the form (to reach it, cursor down to &quot;TYPE&quot; field and press enter), you will see the list of subscribers (we have two in this case: <code>VBECS ADT-A04 CLIENT</code> and <code>HMP ADT-A04 CLIENT</code>).</p>
<pre><code>|                           HL7 EVENT DRIVER                         PAGE 2 OF 2
                         VAFC ADT-A04 SERVER
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
      SENDING APPLICATION: VAFC PIMS
 TRANSACTION MESSAGE TYPE: ADT                        EVENT TYPE: A04
        MESSAGE STRUCTURE:
            PROCESSING ID: P                          VERSION ID: 2.3
          ACCEPT ACK CODE: NE               APPLICATION ACK TYPE: NE

 RESPONSE PROCESSING RTN:
                           SUBSCRIBERS
  VBECS ADT-A04 CLIENT
  HMP ADT-A04 CLIENT




_______________________________________________________________________________

Exit    Save    Previous Page    Refresh    Quit</code></pre>
<p>So bascially, when VistA calls <code>VAFC ADT-A04 SERVER</code>, VistA will send the message to the subscribers <code>VBECS ADT-A04 CLIENT</code> and <code>HMP ADT-A04 CLIENT</code>. For the curious, the registration HL7 message is generated in routine <code>VAFCA04</code> using this line of code: <code>D GENERATE^HLMA(&quot;VAFC ADT-A04 SERVER&quot;,&quot;LM&quot;,1,.HLRST,&quot;&quot;,.HL)</code>.</p>
<p>There are a couple more details we need to talk about. If you move your cursor to one of the subscribers, and press enter, you will see a bunch of fields, three of which are important.</p>

_______________________________________________________________________________</code></pre>
<p>The important fields we need to look at are <code>LOGICAL LINK</code>, <code>PROCESSING RTN</code>, and <code>ROUTING LOGIC</code>. The way they are used is confusing. They actually override each other, in this order:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>If the programmer creates an <code>HLL(&quot;LINKS&quot;)</code> array, that overrides everything, and none of the following steps take place. HLL(&quot;LINKS&quot;) basically tells VistA to ignore all the subscribers and use the subscribers in the HLL(&quot;LINKS&quot;) array. That means that steps 2-4 are evaluated for the subscribers in the HLL(&quot;LINKS&quot;) array.</li>
<li>If <code>ROUTING LOGIC</code> is specified, that is executed; and nothing else is.</li>
<li>If <code>LOGICAL LINK</code> is specified, the message is delivered to the IP address/ domain name on the logical link and then we stop.</li>
<li>If neither <code>LOGICAL LINK</code> nor <code>ROUTING LOGIC</code> is specified, then the message is assumed to be an internal VistA to itself message, and the code for <code>PROCESSING RTN</code> is used. If <code>PROCESSING RTN</code> is not filled out, that's an error condition.</li>
</ol>
<p>For most users, using a <code>LOGICAL LINK</code> to send a message out to an external system is the correct thing to do.</p>
<p>Here are the steps for setting up to send a message from VistA to the outside:</p>
<ul>
<li>Create Logical Link</li>
<li>Enable Logical Link</li>
<li>Create Subscriber Client &amp; Receiving Application</li>
<li>(Application Specific) Enable Sending HL7 messages</li>
<li>Test</li>
</ul>
<p>In this example, what I will do is receive the message using the <a href="http://netcat.sourceforge.net/">netcat</a> program, which is a generic socket listener; and then we will download <a href="https://www.nextgen.com/products-and-services/NextGen-Connect-Integration-Engine-Downloads">Mirth</a> and use it to receive a message. Mirth is an HL7 (and other formats) integration engine -- and it's a realistic target to receive HL7 messages.</p>
<h2 id="outgoing-message-setup">Outgoing Message Setup</h2>
<h3 id="create-logical-link">Create Logical Link</h3>
<p>In real life, you will have a destination machine with an ip/domain name and port number you need to communicate to. For the purposes of this demostration, I will initially set-up a netcat listener on my local machine on port 6661. That means that my new logical link will call 127.0.0.1 port 6661. I will call my link MEMPHIS. Logical links are not typically namespaced. To create a new logical link, goto EVE &gt; HL7 Main Menu &gt; Interface Developer Options &gt; Link Edit [EL]</p>

<p>NB: There is a recently introduced bug in HLCSTCP3 (patched up to 157 on the second line), line 69, which says:</p>
<p><code>Q:(HLOS'[&quot;VMS&quot;)&amp;(HLOS'[&quot;UNIX&quot;)  X &quot;U IO:(::&quot;&quot;-M&quot;&quot;)&quot;</code></p>
<p>This line is incorrect in many regards: it assumes all Cache systems run on VMS or UNIX; and it assumes that all UNIX systems will be Cache. Neither of these assumptions are correct.</p>
<p>It's safe to comment this line out. A more proper fix which takes into account other M systems can be found <a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/shabiel/foia-vista-fixes/master/Routines/HLCSTCP3.m">here</a>.

<p>If you crash with this error: OBX+10^RGADTP, Undefined local variable: HL(SFN), it means that you did not change the station number that came with FOIA (050) and some downstream code is expecting 3 digit station numbers. This error comes from the subscriber <code>RG ADT-A04 TRIGGER</code>, which you may have seen when editing the subscribers for EVENT DRIVER <code>VAFC ADT-A04 SERVER</code>. Without having to do the station numbers as described in <a href="./InitializeVistA.html#setup-your-institution">Initailize VistA</a>, you can just go to the subscribers again, move the cursor to <code>RG ADT-A04 TRIGGER</code>, and then type &quot;@&quot; to remove it.</p>

<h2 id="setup-mirth-for-message-receipt">Setup Mirth for Message Receipt</h2>
<p>Now we are going to set-up Mirth to receive a message. <a href="http://www.mirthcorp.com/">Mirth</a> is what is known as an integration engine. An integration engine is essentially a store/transform/and forward software for messages between different systems. Mirth is open source software and is frequently used with VistA in production implementations. It can be downloaded from <a href="https://www.nextgen.com/products-and-services/NextGen-Connect-Integration-Engine-Downloads">here</a>.</p>
<h3 id="install-mirth">Install Mirth</h3>
<p>I won't cover how to install Mirth. You are on your own for that. It's not as simple as it used to be due to changes on how Java applications can be launched. The main install should also install the program &quot;Mirth Connect Administrator Launcher&quot;, which is what you need to launch in order to launch Mirth Connect.</p>
<p>Once you turn on the &quot;Administrator Launcher&quot;, this is what you should see:</p>
<figure>
<img src="images/SetupHL7/mirth_connect_administrator_launcher.png" class="align-center" />
</figure>
<p>After that, you see the login for Mirth Connect:</p>
<figure>
<img src="images/SetupHL7/mirth_connect_login.png" class="align-center" />
</figure>
<p>Login with the default username/password (unless you have changed them) of admin/admin. Mirth Connect Administrator will be launched, and you will be greeted with a welcome screen. Fill that in appropriately and click Finish.</p>
<figure>
<img src="images/SetupHL7/mirth_welcome_screen.png" class="align-center" />
</figure>
<p>At last, you will get the main screen for Mirth Connect Administrator:</p>
<figure>
<img src="images/SetupHL7/mirth_connect_administrator_main_screen.png" class="align-center" />
</figure>
<p>Note that all the &quot;hot buttons&quot; are on the left hand side. To edit Channels, we need to click on &quot;Channels&quot;.</p>
<h3 id="set-up-a-channel">Set-up a Channel</h3>
<p>Click on &quot;Channels&quot;. The left hand side will get a new drop down called &quot;Channel Tasks&quot;. Click on &quot;New Channel&quot;. This is what you will see:</p>
<figure>
<img src="images/SetupHL7/mirth_new_channel_summary.png" class="align-center" />
</figure>
<p>We are currently on the summary tab. All we have to do here is put a name, like &quot;VistA HL7 Receiver&quot;. The data type on the channel is by default HL7 2.x, so we don't need to modify that. Now click on the &quot;Source Tab&quot;. You will initially see this:</p>
<figure>
<img src="images/SetupHL7/mirth_new_channel_source1.png" class="align-center" />
</figure>
<p>Change the connector type (first drop down) to &quot;TCP Listener&quot;, and review the setting you see here.</p>
<figure>
<img src="images/SetupHL7/mirth_new_channel_source2.png" class="align-center" />
</figure>
<p>The only thing you may want to change is the Local Port, in order for it to match VistA. I already chose 6661 for VistA, so we should be good to go. If you are running VistA in UTF-8 mode, or another mode, you need to double check the encoding matches the data you will be sending from VistA.</p>
<p>On the right hand side, click on Channel Tasks &gt; Save Changes. Then click on Channel Tasks &gt; Deploy Channel, and confirm that you really want to deploy it.</p>
<p>Now you will see the Dashboard with the enabled channel:</p>
<figure>
<img src="images/SetupHL7/mirth_dashboard_after_deploy.png" class="align-center" />
</figure>
<h3 id="send-test-hl7-message-to-mirth">Send Test HL7 Message to Mirth</h3>
<p>Run the test again that we ran before:</p>
<pre><code>$ mumps -dir

<h3 id="view-message-in-mirth">View message in Mirth</h3>
<p>In a few moments, the Mirth Dashboard will now show that you have a new message:</p>
<figure>
<img src="images/SetupHL7/mirth_dashboard_after_test_message.png" class="align-center" />
</figure>
<p>To view the message, double click on the VistA HL7 Receiver row, and you will be taken to the Channel Messages view</p>
<figure>
<img src="images/SetupHL7/mirth_channel_messages_view.png" class="align-center" />
</figure>
<p>Click on the top row (the one saying &quot;TRANSFORMED). Once you do that, you will see the full contents of the message that VistA sent.</p>
<figure>
<img src="images/SetupHL7/mirth_channel_messages_view_message.png" class="align-center" />
</figure>
<h2 id="turn-on-hl7-messages-in-mas-parameters">Turn on HL7 messages in MAS Parameters</h2>
<p>Once we have confirmed that the system to send HL7 messages for patient registrations seems to work, let's turn it on. You need to change field <code>SEND PIMS HL7 V2.3 MESSAGES</code> in file <code>MAS PARAMETERS</code> to <code>SEND</code>. I think it comes set that way by default in FOIA VistA.</p>

<h2 id="register-a-patient">Register a Patient</h2>
<p>Now it's time to register a patient, and see the HL7 come across. This time log-in into the front door using ^ZU. On GT.M/YottaDB, that's <code>$gtm_dist/mumps -r ZU</code>; on Cache, that's <code>csession &lt;instance&gt; -U &lt;namespace&gt; ZU</code>. Use the access and verify codes you set-up in <a href="./InitializeVistA.html">Initialize VistA</a>.</p>
<p>I should note that if you do not finish all the registration steps, an A04 message won't get generated. Instead, an A08 message (patient update) is generated if you exit early. That doesn't make any good sense to me, but that's the way the code is written.</p>
<p>Note the <code>^Register a Patient</code>. A ^ in front of a menu means search all the menu system for that option and run it.</p>
