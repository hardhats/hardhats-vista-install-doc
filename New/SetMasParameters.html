<p>If you have reached this point, it means that you have finished <a href="./InitializeVistA.html">VistA Initialization</a>.</p>
<p>If you go to CPRS right now, you will see this on the patient selection screen if you click on <code>Wards</code> in the <code>Patient Selection</code> area. Our objective in this section and the next section is to set-up a hospital in our VistA system with a couple of wards.</p>

<h1 id="introduction-to-the-steps">Introduction to the Steps</h1>
<ul>
<li>Set-up Nursing Site Parameters</li>
<li>Set-up HINQ Parameters file</li>
<li>Add Services</li>
<li>MAS Parameter Entry/Edit</li>
<li>G&amp;L Parameter Edit</li>
<li>Set-up Treating Specialities</li>
</ul>
<p>The first three steps take place in Fileman. The rest of the steps take place in various menus. If you want, you can set-up a real or PDF printer. This is covered extensively at Vistapedia: <a href="http://www.vistapedia.com/index.php/Setting_up_a_VISTA_Printer" class="uri">http://www.vistapedia.com/index.php/Setting_up_a_VISTA_Printer</a>. If you don't set one up, you can just set the printer to <code>NULL</code>.</p>
<h1 id="nursing-site-parameters">Nursing Site Parameters</h1>
<p>FOIA comes with a broken file in 213.9. In order to be able to edit it, we have to set it up manually. From direct mode, we do some fixes; and then we go to Fileman to edit it.</p>
