If you have reached this point, it means that you have finished `Install Cache <./InstallCache.html>`_; or `Install GT.M/YottaDB <./InstallGTM.html>`_ and `Install VistA on GT.M/YottaDB <./InstallVistAOnGTM.html>`_.

GT.M/YottaDB Note
-----------------
YottaDB is a fork of GT.M. In VistA, everything that says GT.M will work equally well for YottaDB. When running ``^ZTMGRSET`` or ``^DINIT``, choose GT.M on Unix for YottaDB.

Getting into the Direct Mode (AKA Programmer Mode)
--------------------------------------------------
Before there were `REPLs <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Read%E2%80%93eval%E2%80%93print_loop>`_, Mumps always has had something called Direct Mode, also known as Programmer Mode, which is a simplified REPL. Normally, end users are not allowed to access Programmer Mode as it is essentially like running as root on a Unix System.

To connect to VISTA and start configuring it, you need a terminal emulator that emulates VT-100, VT-220, VT-320 or VT-52. By default, most terminal emulators do that already, but you cannot use the rxvt terminal emulator.

If you modified your $TERM, you need to make sure it's either ``xterm`` or ``ansi``. Others generally will work, but I am sure of these two.

To get into Direct Mode using Cache, on Windows you need to right click on the Cache Cube and choose Terminal. If you have a licensed version of Cache, you can also use Telnet to connect to the Terminal. Please note that Windows Telnet does not emulate VT-200 series terminals properly, so you may have some issues with it. If you want to use Telnet, I recommend downloading PuTTY (http://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/putty/) or TeraTerm (https://ttssh2.osdn.jp/index.html.en).

If you use PuTTY, change the function key bindings so that they behave like VT-100+. See here: https://the.earth.li/~sgtatham/putty/0.58/htmldoc/Chapter4.html#config-funkeys.

On a Mac, Terminal is a fully featured terminal emulator. You may wish to use System Preferences to configure the function keys to send Function commands, rather than dimming your screen or muting your volume. Otherwise, you have to use FN all the time to override the function keys (https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT204436).

On Linux, you can use any Terminal Emulator program with the exception of rxvt. You can actually even use PuTTY on Linux, but F1 may be bound to do help. You need to unmap that in the Terminal application (http://askubuntu.com/questions/37313/how-do-i-deactivate-f1-and-f10-keybindings-in-gnome-terminal).

If a VistA system was installed by you or somebody else in the "Cloud", you will almost certainly need to use Secure Shell (SSH) to log in.  If you use Telnet, there are some existential questions you have to ask yourself. SSH is a protocol written in the mid-90s to replace Telnet. It's the standard of connecting to other computers on the Cloud. Nobody can see the traffic inside of SSH, whereas Telnet is just plain text.  The ssh client comes installed by default in all Unices; on
Windows, you can use PuTTY or TeraTerm.

After you open your terminal emulator, do the following:

If your VistA is hosted on a remote server, connect to that first.

On Cache on Linux or Mac, you need to run ``ccontrol list`` to find your instance name, and then run ``csession <instance name>``.

On GT.M/YottaDB, you need to source your environment file. If you followed this guide, it should be in /var/db/<name> as env.vista. To source, type ``. /var/db/<name>/env.vista`` (The dot is all by itself, followed by a space). Then type ``mumps -dir`` to go into direct mode.

You will see something like this:

.. raw:: html
    
    <div class="code"><code>GTM></code></div>

or in Cache:

.. raw:: html

    <div class="code"><code>USER></code></div>

If you are in Cache, you need to switch namespaces. (If you don't remember, type ? to see your choices.)

.. raw:: html
    
    <div class="code"><code>><strong>D ^%CD</strong>
    
    NAMESPACE// <strong>VISTA</strong></code></div>

Note to GT.M/YottaDB Users
--------------------------
Due to the fact that Cache does not enforce the M standard as strictly, many illegal instructions have been incorporated into VistA code. In addition, neither Cache nor GT.M/YottaDB is fully M95 standards compliant. As a result, ensuring that new code supports both systems is something of a game. For these reasons, the hardhats community maintains fixes for these routines and, when possible, sends the fixes back to the VA. In the future, the OSEHRA repositories will contain the fixes so that end users don't have to download the code and fix it themselves.

The WorldVistA distribution of VistA is GT.M/YottaDB compatible; you don't need any fixes for it, but the following provides a lot more functionality.

If you downloaded vxVistA or FOIA VistA, you need to copy the routines from this repository to your routines directory: https://github.com/shabiel/Kernel-GTM. Here's how to do it:

.. code-block:: bash

    $ wget https://github.com/shabiel/Kernel-GTM/releases/download/XU-8.0-10001/virgin_install.zip
    $ unzip virgin_install.zip -d /path/to/database/r/

Note to Cache Users
-------------------
The evaluation version of Cache won't let you run more than one foreground process and 20 background processes. You can certainly configure VistA, but don't try to run the RPC broker. A "friend" wasted a lot of my time because he had an evaluation version and couldn't start the RPC broker. You may also need to restart Cache repeatedly, as it sometimes "forgets" that you logged off.

Commands and what they mean (a short M primer)
----------------------------------------------
In the excerpts below, you will enter Mumps (M) commands into direct mode. Here are a few interesting ones:

.. code-block:: M

    S DUZ=.5 ; S is a shortcut for SET, DUZ means user number; .5 is a user that is always present on VistA systems.

    D ^XUP ; D is a shortcut for DO, ^XUP is the name of the routine. ^XUP is the programmer mode menu runner.

    ; A semicolon, like in GAS assembly, is the comment character. M, like C, was written to replace assembly.

    D Q^DI ; Do starting from Label Q in Routine DI. Q^DI is how to enter Fileman.

VistA Text Mode Conventions
---------------------------
There are a few confusing conventions that outsiders don't understand right away. Here they are:

* ``//`` means that the preceding text is the default. If you press enter, you will accept it.
* ``Replace`` means that the existing text is long and you can edit it. Typing ``...`` means that you will replace the entire thing;
* ``END`` appends to the end. You can also use ``...`` to signify a range between two elements in the existing text. You can also enter a unique segment of the text, press enter, and at the with prompt put in what you want to replace that bit of text with. If you don't type anything in, it deletes that part of the text.
* ``@`` deletes an item.
* ``^`` usually lets you quit what you are in the middle of.
* ``^FIELD NAME`` lets you jump to a field while editing other fields. You may be blocked, depending on what the programmer decided to allow.
* ``?`` Short Help. Typically it tells you that you need to type a number or text.
* ``??`` More Help. Should tell you what the field you are filling does. In the menu system, show all menus with what security keys they need.
* ``???`` In the menu system, display help for each immediate submenu.
* ``????`` In the menu system, display help for current menu.
* ``<enter>`` key is the main navigation key in VistA. Typing it after an entry enters that entry; typing when nothing is entered will move you forward or up, depending on the context.
* ``Select <item>`` Whenever you see select, you can select or add an item; after that, you can edit it.
* ``Spacebar <enter>`` Most of the time, VistA remembers the last entry you made for a particular field. To make the same entry again, do spacebar enter.

Begin to Set Up the VistA System
================================
Before you Start
----------------
You need to either invent or be given a few pieces of data:

* What are you going to call your Hospital or Clinic?
* What's your station number? If you use VISTA or RPMS deployed by VA, IHS, or an external vendor; they will assign you your station number. Otherwise, pick a number from 130 to 199; or 971 to 999. These numbers are not used by the VA in VistA. In this guide, we will use 999.
* What's your domain name? If you have a domain, use it; otherwise, invent one like ``WWW.HABIEL.NAME``.
* What's your parent domain? If you are not part of VA or IHS, you can use OSEHRA Forum: ``FORUM.OSEHRA.ORG``.
* Are you running on Cache vs GT.M/YottaDB; and what operating system you are running on? If you followed this guide from the very beginning, you would certainly know; but day to day users of VistA have no idea actually what it is running on.
* What port number will you have VistA listen on for the RPC Broker? By convention, it's either 9000, 9200, or 9211.
* What's the maximum number of processes that you will allow at once on a VistA system? Today (2016), commodity hardware (a good laptop, for example), can handle up to 200 concurrent processes. I usually set my test instances with a maximum of 30 processes, which is the number I use below.
* What's your DNS Server? If you don't know, just use 8.8.8.8.

Some of the configuration items below are taken from a system that may have had these entries previously created. If what you see on your screen doesn't exactly match what you see here, you can reply to Fileman with "Y" when adding a new entry; and skip past the fields that are indented by pressing ``<enter>``. What matters in the end is that the final entry matches what is typed here.

Device Configuration
--------------------
The very first thing we want to do is to set-up 4 devices: NULL, CONSOLE, VIRTUAL, and HFS (historically known as TELNET, due to usual access assignments). The NULL device corresponds to a place where we dump data we don't want; that's ``/dev/null`` on all Unices; ``//./nul`` on Windows. The NULL device is also known as the "BIT BUCKET", for obvious reasons.

CONSOLE stands for the device the terminal presents itself as if directly connected to a computer. These days, no computer has real console devices. Linux still has an emulated console device: ``/dev/tty``. Cache Terminal presents a console device called ``|TRM|``.

VIRTUAL stands for all connections from Virtual Emulators. Unfortunately every different operating system provides a different console device:

* Linux: ``/dev/pts`` (Use with both Cache and GT.M/YottaDB)
* macOS: ``/dev/ttys`` (ditto)
* Cygwin: ``/dev/cons`` (GT.M [no YottaDB port for Cygwin exists])
* Cache Telnet: ``|TNT|`` (Cache/Windows ONLY)

The way set up devices is to edit the DEVICE file in Fileman, the Database Management System for VistA. Unlike most databases in the market, it provides a user interface as well, albeit a text-based one. To get into Fileman, you need to set your user (DUZ) to .5, and then go in.

NULL Device
***********
There should only be one device named "NULL". Unfortunately, there are three NULLs of various flavors in the FOIA; we need to make sure there is only one. The following procedure allows you to rename the nulls we don't want, and then delete a synonym.

At this point, we need to make sure that $I (short for $IO) for the device is correct for the system. All Unices have ``/dev/null``; Windows is ``//./nul``.

    <div class="code"><code>Select OPTION: <strong>EN</strong>TER OR EDIT FILE ENTRIES

    Input to what File: DEVICE// <strong>&lt;enter&gt;</strong>             (54 entries)

    $I: /dev/null// <strong>//./nul</strong> (or leave it alone as it is correct for Unix).
    
    Select DEVICE NAME: <strong>&lt;enter&gt;</strong></code></div>

CONSOLE Device
**************
If you use Cache on Windows or Linux; or GT.M/YottaDB, you should be set *theoretically*. However, the FOIA set-up is incomplete or overspecified. I would prefer to select an entry and make sure it's properly specified:

You need to fill these fields *and no others*, as follows:

* NAME = CONSOLE
* $I = /dev/tty on Linux; |TRM| on Cache/Windows.
* LOCATION OF TERMINAL = Physical Console
* TYPE = VIRTUAL TERMINAL
* SUBTYPE = C-VT220
* SIGN-ON/SYSTEM DEVICE = YES

Here's an example:

.. raw:: html

    <div class="code"><code>Select OPTION: <strong>EN</strong>TER OR EDIT FILE ENTRIES  



    Input to what File: DEVICE//  <strong>&lt;enter&gt;</strong>            (54 entries)

    THEN EDIT FIELD: <strong>$I</strong>
    THEN EDIT FIELD: <strong>LOCATION OF TERMINAL  </strong>
    THEN EDIT FIELD: <strong>TYPE</strong>
         1   TYPE  
         2   TYPE-AHEAD  
    CHOOSE 1-2: 1  <strong>TYPE</strong>
    THEN EDIT FIELD: <strong>SUBTYPE</strong>
    THEN EDIT FIELD: <strong>SIGN-ON/SYSTEM DEVICE</strong>
    THEN EDIT FIELD: <strong>&lt;enter&gt;</strong>
    STORE THESE FIELDS IN TEMPLATE: <strong>&lt;enter&gt;</strong>


    Select DEVICE NAME: <strong>CONSOLE</strong>
         1   CONSOLE      CONSOLE     OPA     
         2   CONSOLE  GTM-UNIX-CONSOLE    Console (GT.M)     /dev/tty

    SIGN-ON/SYSTEM DEVICE: <strong>Y</strong>  YES
    </code></div>

VIRTUAL Device
**************
The FOIA only comes with Linux Virtual Terminal. As before, here's what you need to fill it out. 

* NAME = VIRTUAL TERMINAL
* $I = /dev/pts on Linux; /dev/ttys on macOS; /dev/cons on Cygwin; |TNT| on Cache/Windows.
* LOCATION OF TERMINAL = Virtual Terminal
* TYPE = VIRTUAL TERMINAL
* SUBTYPE = C-VT220
* SIGN-ON/SYSTEM DEVICE = YES

HFS Device
**********
The HFS device is necessary because KIDS (the installation system used by VISTA) uses it to open files on the operating system. (Technically, it only uses the Open Parameters field.) The one that comes in FOIA looks like this:

.. code-block::

    NAME: HFS                               $I: USER$:[TEMP]TMP.DAT
    ASK DEVICE: YES                       ASK PARAMETERS: YES
    LOCATION OF TERMINAL: Host File Server
    ASK HOST FILE: YES                    ASK HFS I/O OPERATION: YES
    OPEN COUNT: 870                       OPEN PARAMETERS: "WNS"
    SUBTYPE: P-OTHER                      TYPE: HOST FILE SERVER

You need to select it and change the settings as follows:

* NAME = HFS
* $I  = /tmp/hfs.dat or /dev/shm/hfs.dat or d:\\hfs\\, depending on your operating system (All Unices has /tmp/; only Linux has /dev/shm; last one is an example on Windows)
* ASK DEVICE = YES
* ASK PARAMETERS = @ (Delete it)
* LOCATION OF TERMINAL = Host File Server
* ASK HOST FILE = YES
* ASK HFS I/O OPERATION = @ (Delete it)
* OPEN PARAMETERS: "WNS" for Cache, (newversion) for GT.M/YottaDB (note quotes on Cache and their absence on GT.M/YottaDB)
* SUBYTPE: P-HFS/80/99999
* TYPE: HOST FILE SERVER

ZTMGRSET
--------
The routine ZTMGRSET defines VistA global variables and saves system wide M routines that are M and OS specific. We need to kill ^%ZOSF to make sure we don't have old answers here; and sometimes having ^%ZOSF when you have just switched M implementations causes a catch 22 problem. The text scrape below is for GT.M/YottaDB; the one for Cache follows it.

Instance Domain, Parent Domain, and Q-PATCH domain
--------------------------------------------------
Next, a domain should be set up for the VistA instance.  A domain name is typically used to uniquely identify an instance on a network.  The parent domain is the domain responsible for routing your traffic to the outside world. The Q-PATCH domain is only necessary for developers wishing to use OSEHRA Forum. First we add the entry to the ``DOMAIN`` file through Fileman.

The next step is to find the IEN of the instance domain. This can be done by inquiring about the entry using Fileman and printing the Record Number:

.. raw:: html
    
    <div class="code"><code>><strong>S DUZ=.5 D Q^DI</strong>
    
    VA Fileman 22.2
    
    Select OPTION: <strong>5</strong>  INQUIRE TO FILE ENTRIES
    
    OUTPUT FROM WHAT FILE: DOMAIN// <strong>DOMAIN</strong>   (71 entries)
    Select DOMAIN NAME: <strong>DEMO.OSEHRA.ORG</strong>
    ANOTHER ONE: <strong>&lt;enter&gt;</strong>
    STANDARD CAPTIONED OUTPUT? Yes// <strong>Y</strong>  (Yes)
    Include COMPUTED fields:  (N/Y/R/B): NO// <strong>Record Number (IEN)</strong>
    
    NUMBER: 76                              NAME: DEMO.OSEHRA.ORG
    
    Select DOMAIN NAME: <strong>&lt;enter&gt;</strong>
    
    Select OPTION: <strong>&lt;enter&gt;</strong>
    ></code></div>


Then we propagate that entry to the ``Kernel System Parameters`` and ``RPC Broker Site Parameters`` files. The value that is being set should be the same as the ``NUMBER`` value from the above result.

.. raw:: html
    
    <div class="code"><code>><strong>S $P(^XWB(8994.1,1,0),"^")=76</strong>
    ><strong>S $P(^XTV(8989.3,1,0),"^")=76</strong></code></div>

Re-index the files after making this change.

Set-up Taskman
--------------
Taskman is the VistA subsystem that is responsible for running processes in the background.

The first step is to find the box volume pair for the local machine.

.. raw:: html
    
    <div class="code"><code>><strong>D GETENV^%ZOSV W Y</strong></code></div>

which will print out a message with four parts separated by ``^`` that could look something like (Cache):

.. raw:: html
    
    <div class="code"><code>VISTA^VISTA^palaven^VISTA:CACHE</code></div>

or (GT.M/YottaDB)

.. raw:: html

    <div class="code"><code>VAH^ROU^Macintosh^ROU:Macintosh</code></div>

The four pieces of the string are:

``UCI^VOL^NODE^VOLUME:BOX``

The fourth piece, the VOLUME:BOX pair, is referred to as the "BOX VOLUME pair". The first component of the Box Volume pair is the Volume Set, which is used to define the location of routines for the VistA system. The second component, Box, references the system where the instance is found. In a Caché system, it would be the name of the Caché instance; while on GT.M/YottaDB, it should reference the hostname of the machine.

The Volume Set result needs to be altered in the ``VOLUME SET`` file, and we will reuse some setup by writing over the name of the first entry that is already in the VistA system.  The first entry, the entry with an IEN of 1, can be selected by entering ```1``.

Then we rename the first Box-Volume pair in the ``Taskman Site Parameters`` file to match what was found above.

For this demonstration instance, the Volume Set will be ``ROU``, as per the output above.

Kernel Set-Up
-------------
We are not done with setting Taskman up yet; but we need to fix the Volume multiple and several other items our in the Kernel System Parameters file first:

* AGENCY CODE = EHR (We are not running this inside of the VA)
* VOLUME SET:VOLUME SET = ROU
* VOLUME SET:MAX SIGNON ALLOWED = 30 (That's the maximum number of processes allowed to run)
* VOLUME SET:LOG SYSTEM RT? = @ (delete)
* DNS IP = Your DNS Server, or a public one
* DEFAULT AUTO-MENU = YES (print menus automatically)
* INTRO MESSSAGE (word-processing) = Put whatever you want here. This is what users see when they log-on.

Back to Taskman
---------------
At this point, we are ready to go back to getting Taskman to run. We will now run ``^ZTMCHK`` which checks our work and makes sure we didn't screw up royally.

    End of listing.  Press RETURN to continue:</code></div>

If ANY of the fields in the last screen are empty, except "Log Tasks?", you made a mistake. Double check your work.

Next we need to initialize the recurring and start-up tasks that VistA will run.  The set of tasks you want your system to run with is very variable; you can see this page for guidance: http://www.vistapedia.com/index.php/Taskman_Recurring_Tasks. We will set these base tasks, which every VistA system ought to have, up on your VistA system:

Start-up Jobs:

* XWB LISTENER STARTER  (Starts RPC Broker)
* XOBV LISTENER STARTUP (Starts VistALink Broker)
* XUSER-CLEAR-ALL (Cleans signed on users for a system that just got booted)
* XUDEV RES-CLEAR (Clear resource devices for a system that just got booted)
* XMMGR-START-BACKGROUND-FILER (Start mailman background processor)

Nightly Jobs:

* XMAUTOPURGE (Delete unreferenced mail messages)
* XMCLEAN (Delete from system messages deleted by users)
* XMMGR-PURGE-AI-XREF (Delete duplicate network messages)
* XQBUILDTREEQUE (Rebuild the menus in the menu system)
* XQ XUTL $J NODES (IMPORTANT: Delete left over temp globals from process activity)
* XUERTRP AUTO CLEAN (Cleans the error trap after 7 days)
* XUTM QCLEAN (Clean Task file from completed tasks if the task didn't delete itself after it ran)

Beyond these tasks, which tasks you run depends on what's important to you: if you write notes, you will want TIU tasks; if you use Drug Accountability, you will want PSA tasks; etc.

FOIA VistA comes with a lot of junk, so I advise starting from a clean slate. Be careful with the next few commands: they should never be run on an existing system, otherwise they may delete patient data:

.. raw:: html
    
    <div class="code"><code>><strong>K ^%ZTSK,^%ZTSCH</strong> ; clean taskman Globals
    ><strong>D DT^DICRW S DIK="^DIC(19.2," F DA=0:0 S DA=$O(^DIC(19.2,DA)) Q:'DA  D ^DIK</strong> ; Delete all tasks</code></div>

Next add the tasks outlined above to OPTION SCHEDULING (#19.2). The startup entries will only need the NAME and SPECIAL QUEUING fields; the nightly jobs will need NAME, QUEUED TO RUN AT WHAT TIME, and RESCHEDULING FREQUENCY fields.

There are actually just two more steps:

* Run ``DO ^ZTMB`` to start Taskman. *NOTE THAT IS THIS THE ONLY WAY TO START TASKMAN!* Restarting Taskman means that data control structure from the old system will be assumed to be correct. Don't do it!
* Run ``DO ^ZTMON`` to confirm that everything is running.

You should see this (press enter several times to update the screen, it should take at least 1 second to start); to exit, type ``^``.

Setup your Institution
----------------------
VistA has a very complex structure to deal with the question of: in what hospital are you signed in right now? The answer determines the value of the all important variable ``DUZ(2)`` and the API ``SITE^VASITE()``.

There are five files that are important in that regard: INSTITUTION (#4), STATION NUMBER (TIME SENSITIVE) (#389.9), KERNEL SYSTEM PARAMETERS (#8989.3), MEDICAL CENTER DIVISION file (#40.8), and MASTER PATIENT INDEX (LOCAL NUMBERS) (984.1). We will add our Hospital to the INSTITUTION file first, with the station number 999. Then we will make sure that the STATION NUMBER file says 999; and then will will point the KERNEL SYSTEM PARAMETERS and MEDICAL CENTER DIVISION to our new Hospital. In MASTER PATIENT INDEX, we tell it our station number and the range of numbers for our Integration Control Numbers (ICNs), the number used to identify patients across systems.

By default, FOIA VistA comes with station number 050, and the institution is called SOFTWARE SERVICE. We can't leave that alone because VistA malfunctions with station numbers are are just 2 digits long (050 becomes 50 in code).

The INSITUTION file is protected from editing by requiring the variable XUMF to be defined. That tells us that inside of the VA, the file is updated by something called Standard Terminology Services (STS), which works by sending VistA mail messages of what to update, and VistA creates the entry based on that mail message. Normally when you see that, you should stay the hell out of the file: it's standardized and should not be tampered with. However, people outside of the VA have no other way to run VistA without updating this file.

We enter Fileman after setting the XUMF variable. Note that in the US, we are supposed to fill the NPI variable, and Fileman won't let me go further without filling it; but I was able to jump forward to avoid answering it. Also, note that we have to fill the STATION NUMBER entry twice, once in the field named so, and another time in the coding system multiple.

Okay, let's kill our symbol table (the table that keeps our current variables), log-in, and then run ``$$SITE^VASITE``.

    <div class="code"><code>><strong>K  S DUZ=.5 D ^XUP</strong>

    ><strong>W $$SITE^VASITE()</strong>

As you can see, our DUZ(2) matches our site number, and $$SITE^VASITE() gives us the correct site number and station number.


Setup RPC Broker
----------------
Next, we set-up a port for CPRS to connect. CPRS connects to the Remote Procedure Calls Broker, and it connects using Remote Procedures. The next step is to edit entries in the RPC Broker Site Parameters file. The RPC Broker steps will set up information that references both the Port that the listener will listen on and the Box Volume pair of the instance.

    Select RPC BROKER SITE PARAMETERS DOMAIN NAME: <strong>&lt;enter&gt;</strong></code></div>

Now, start the listener:

.. raw:: html
    
    <div class="code"><code>><strong>D ^XUP</strong>

    Setting up programmer environment
    This is a TEST account.

    Terminal Type set to: C-VT100

    Select OPTION NAME: <strong>XWB LISTEN</strong>
         1   XWB LISTENER EDIT       RPC Listener Edit
         2   XWB LISTENER STARTER       Start All RPC Broker Listeners
         3   XWB LISTENER STOP ALL       Stop All RPC Broker Listeners
    CHOOSE 1-3: <strong>2</strong>  XWB LISTENER STARTER     Start All RPC Broker Listeners

              has been queued as task 32372</code></div>

Finally, we need to check that the broker started. While you may use ^%SS or ^ZSY to find that out, I prefer OS level tools that show me that the port is active.

On Mac or Linux, you can run ``lsof -iTCP -sTCP:LISTEN -P``; on Linux, ``netstat -tnlp``; on Windows (including Cygwin), ``netstat -aon | find /i "listening"``. Here's an example output on a Mac:

.. raw:: html
    
    <div class="code"><code>$ lsof -iTCP -sTCP:LISTEN -P
    COMMAND   PID USER   FD   TYPE             DEVICE SIZE/OFF NODE NAME
    mumps   85939  sam    6u  IPv6 0x5ee953ac0e7fceab      0t0  TCP \*:9000 (LISTEN)</code></div>

If you shut down your system and then bring it back up, starting Taskman using ``^ZTMB`` will start your broker, as we set it up as one of the startup tasks.

Back to business: To check that the RPC Broker is REALLY working, run ``DO ^XWBTCPMT``.

.. raw:: html
    
    <div class="code"><code>><strong>D ^XWBTCPMT</strong>

    Interactive Broker Test
    IP ADDRESS: <strong>127.0.0.1</strong>
    PORT: <strong>9000</strong>

    Success, response: accept</code></div>

Our response was "Success".  If you don't succeed, you may get "Fail". If that happens, refer to this page on troubleshooting the Broker in Vistapedia: http://www.vistapedia.com/index.php/VISTA_XWB_Broker_Troubleshooting.

To stop the broker, ``do ^XUP``, and then choose ``XWB LISTENER STOP ALL``:

.. raw:: html
    
    <div class="code"><code>><strong>D ^XUP</strong>
    Setting up programmer environment
    This is a TEST account.

    Terminal Type set to: C-VT100

    Select OPTION NAME: <strong>XWB LISTENER STOP ALL</strong>       Stop All RPC Broker Listeners
    Stop All RPC Broker Listeners</code></div>

If you run ``lsof -iTCP -sTCP:LISTEN -P`` again, you won't see any output.

Independent of our set-up above, we can start the broker at any port we want from direct mode using ``J ZISTCP^XWBTCPM1(<port no>)``.

To test the broker from the client side, you can download the Broker SDK from the FOIA site:
http://foia-vista.osehra.org/Patches_By_Application/XWB-RPC%20BROKER/XWB_1_1_P60_scrubbed.zip

Once you unzip it, you will find this file: ``./Samples/BrokerEx/BrokerExample.exe``.
Run this, replace the server name and port with your ip address and port, and then click on connect.

.. figure::
   images/InitializeVistA/pic38.png
   :align: center
   :alt: Broker Log-in

Once you click connect, you will see the sign-in dialog: That means that the broker is functional.

Note: Because of the `infamous XUSRB1.m problem <https://groups.google.com/forum/#!msg/hardhats/tmuguZ1GK7k/at_0i82n-zgJ>`_,
you won't be able to log-on right now. But you should be able to using CPRS.


Set Yourself Up as the System Manager
-------------------------------------
This is a super user who will have elevated privileges. You can add other users
such as Physicians, Pharmacists, etc. later. Set up the System Manager user
with minimal information. We will add more information later. By convention, the
super user has a DUZ of 1. So far we have been using the DUZ of .5. We have to use
it one last time to make the system manager. Your access code is really your username.
I set it up as SM1234, but you can put whatever you like. Go back into Fileman using ``S DUZ=.5 D Q^DI``:

.. raw:: html
    
    <div class="code"><code>Select OPTION: <strong>1</strong>   ENTER OR EDIT FILE ENTRIES
    
    INPUT TO WHAT FILE: RPC BROKER PARAMETERS// <strong>200</strong>   NEW PERSON
              (2 entries)
    EDIT WHICH FIELD: ALL// <strong>.01</strong>   NAME
    THEN EDIT FIELD: <strong>ACCESS CODE</strong>   Want to edit ACCESS CODE (Y/N)
    THEN EDIT FIELD: <strong>&lt;enter&gt;</strong>
    
    Select NEW PERSON NAME: <strong>`1</strong>  USER,ONE
    NAME: USER,ONE// <strong>MANAGER,SYSTEM</strong>
    Want to edit ACCESS CODE (Y/N): <strong>Y</strong>
    Enter a new ACCESS CODE <Hidden>: <strong>******</strong>
    Please re-type the new code to show that I have it right: <strong>******</strong>
    OK, Access code has been changed!
    The VERIFY CODE has been deleted as a security measure.
    The user will have to enter a new one the next time they sign-on.
    
    Select NEW PERSON NAME: <strong>&lt;enter&gt;</strong></code></div>

Next give your user privileges appropriate for a system manager. This brings us to VistA's security system.

VistA menu tree is built just like the Windows Registry: Folders (known as menus) which contain other folders
or actual items which you can run. Each menu is like a door: it has a "key" which locks it; or it could be
one of those sliding doors which doesn't have keys. A key to a door (ahem, menu) protects all the subsequent
doors beyond the first door. If you lock the first door, you can keep the doors below it open. When we ran
``DO ^XUP``, what we really did was that we went into the menu system.

Keys are also checked by runtime code in order to give privileges when performing certain operations. It's
a very common practice in VistA for all users to have access to something, but only the holders of specific
keys can perform certain actions. For example, all Lab users have "LRLAB"; but only those credentialed as
Lab Technicians will have "LRVERIFY" to release the result.

Let's enlarge our analogy a bit: Users of the VistA system can be assigned a specific door to enter into:
This is known as their PRIMARY MENU. A prevalent practice is to give everybody the PRIMARY MENU of ``XUCORE``,
which is analogous to a City Portal. Once you say who you are (ACCESS CODE) and your password (VERIFY CODE),
you enter the City (XUCORE) and you can only enter the building for which you have the key.

What we do below is a couple of things: We give ourselves the Fileman Access Code (different from ACCESS CODE)
of "@", which gives you the equivalent of root privileges in Fileman. Next, we give ourselves the keys
``XUMGR`` (let's you add users and manipulate tasks); ``XUPROG`` (let's you edit users [don't ask me why--I have
no clue why they put that key there], and install Software); ``XUPROGMODE`` (let's you enter programmer mode);
``XMMGR`` (let's you manage mailman), ``XUSPF200`` (let's you add users without requiring an SSN).
By the way, privileged users can be given the ability to add new users
and assign and take away keys using a mechanism called delegation. I won't cover that here.

    Select Key Management Option: <strong>&lt;enter&gt;</strong></code></div>


You are now ready to enter additional information for the system manager user
like PRIMARY MENU, VERIFY CODE etc. You MUST enter a VERIFY CODE, otherwise,
you won't be able to log in.

.. raw:: html
    
    <div class="code"><code>><strong>D ^XUP</strong>

    CHOOSE 1-2: <strong>1</strong> XUSEREDIT  Edit an Existing User
    Edit an Existing User
    Select NEW PERSON NAME: <strong>MANAGER,SYSTEM</strong>    SM</code></div>

Now you will be presented with a screen with multiple options. You can navigate
the screen with the TAB key. For navigation help, use your keyboard arrows to
move down to the command line and hold down either the Num Lock key (which is
mapped as PF1 of a VT-320 terminal by Caché) or F1 for other terminal
emulations and hit "H" and then Enter for help. You can exit by typing "^" on
the command line and the change you made will be saved. At a minimum, assign
EVE as the PRIMARY MENU and enter IRM (it's the only choice) as
SERVICE/SECTION. If you plan to use CPRS, enter OR CPRS GUI CHART as a
SECONDARY MENU OPTION. Enter other data as you deem appropriate. If DISUSER or
Termination Reason is set, use the '@' to delete both of them.

.. figure::

   :align: center
   :alt:  Edit an existing user 1

Type "N"EXT PAGE at COMMAND: to go to page 2 to update the TIMED READ field and
other fields you wish to update. For DEFAULT TIMED-READ (SECONDS): if you
change it to 3600 you will be allow an hour before being automatically signed
off. It makes it easier to work when you are learning and setting things up.
And for God's sake, please make sure that your Preferred Editor is ``SCREEN EDITOR -
VA FILEMAN``, otherwise you can only edit a line of text at a time.

Press <PF1> refers to notations for use of Vista on Terminals. For example, the
original VT-320 keyboard had additional character sets and keys which include
Find, Select, Insert, Remove, Previous Screen, Next Screen, an arrow cluster
and F1 to F20. With Terminal Emulators, the Keys are "mapped", which means when you push a
given key it acts as the key would in a terminal. For instance, F1, F2, F3 and
F4 are equivalent to the PF1, PF2, PF3 and PF4 keys on the terminal keyboard
and Page Up and Page Down on the computer keyboard correspond to Previous
Screen and Next Screen.  Also there is lots of information about terminal if 
you are interested at http://www.vt100.net. Also, the very beginning of this
document tells you what are the recommended terminal emulators to use.

At this point, you can go back to Direct Mode. We will now run ``^ZU``, which is the
VistA front door, or in the above analogy, the City Portal. At the VISTA prompt, Type ``D ^ZU``.

At ACCESS CODE, type in the code you chose when setting up MANAGER, SYSTEM as a
NEW PERSON. At VERIFY CODE, enter the verify code you chose for yourself earlier,
and then you will be asked to change it. The introduction message "This is my test
system." is what we put in a while ago in the Kernel Set-Up section.

At Select Systems Manager Menu Option: Type ``OPER``, (short for operations
management) and hit enter. You can see all of the choices available to you if
you type ``??``.

At Select Operations Management Option: Type ``KER`` short for Kernel Management
Menu and hit enter. At Select Kernel Management Menu Option: Type ``ENT``, short
for Enter/Edit Kernel Site Parameters. Hit enter.

You will be presented with a similar screen as in editing the SYSTEM MANAGER
characteristics. You can navigate the screen with the ``TAB`` key. For DEFAULT
TIMED-READ (SECONDS): change it to ``3600`` to allow an hour before being
automatically signed off, or whatever you choose.

I recommend making these other changes:

* DEFAULT MULTIPLE SIGN-ON = YES

Mail a Message
--------------
Now send a message using Postmaster to your DUZ number. From Direct Mode, type ``S DUZ=.5 D ^XUP``. You will get the
response SETTING UP PROGRAMMER ENVIRONMENT then TERMINAL TYPE SET TO: (your
default) and Select OPTION NAME:. You will need to respond: ``XMUSER``. At Select
Mailman Menu Option: type ``S`` (for send). At Subject: enter your subject, such
as Test, and then hit enter. You will then be prompted You may enter the text
of the message and you will be offered the line number 1> where you can type
your message, such as the infamous Hello world. Next will be line 2> and if you
are done, just hit enter and at EDIT Option: you can do the same. At Send mail
to: POSTMASTER// enter the initials you used for your DUZ which were probably
DBA for System Manager. You will then be told when Mailman was last used, which
is probably NEVER. Hit enter at And Send to: and you should receive the message
Select Message option: Transmit now// at which you hit enter and will hopefully
receive the message Sending [1] Sent. Type ``^`` to exit.

Now see if you received it. Log on using ``D ^ZU``. At the Systems Manager
prompt, type ``MAILMAN MENU``. Then at the Select Mailman Menu Option: type ``NEW``

Add CPRS User
-------------
The next step is to create a user that can sign on to the CPRS GUI.
The things to make sure that this new user has are

* A Secondary menu option of "OR CPRS GUI CHART"
* CPRS Tab Access
* An ACCESS CODE
* A VERIFY CODE
* Service/Section (required for any user)

The menu option ensures that the user has the proper permissions to access
CPRS after signing in with their ACCESS and VERIFY codes.  The Tab access
can limit the amount of things a user can access once they have signed in.

The adding of the user is done through the User Management menu in the
menu system, which will ask for information in a series of prompts then will
open a Screenman form to complete the task.

The following steps will add a generic ``CPRS,USER`` person who will be able to
sign into CPRS.

On the fourth page, CPRS Tab Access is set. Navigate first to "RESTRICT PATIENT
SELECTION", set that to "NO", and then navigate the cursor to the location
under the ``Name`` header and enter ``COR``, which stands ``for Core Tab Access``,
and enter an effective date of yesterday, ``T-1`` is the notation to use.

Once that is done, save and exit the Screenman form via the COMMAND box and
then answer the final questions regarding access letters, security keys
and mail groups. For security keys, there are two we need to add: ORES and PROVIDER.

At this point, CPRS can successfully connect to the local VistA instance and
the ``CPRS,USER`` will be able to sign on and interact with the GUI.

Downloading CPRS and Running It
-------------------------------
The next part is laborious and tedious: finding the correct vesion of CPRS to run on
your FOIA instance. 

*NB: If you have been following on a Linux or Mac machine so far, you need to switch
to Windows or use Wine 1.8 or higher to run CPRS. Earlier versions of Wine had an
unimplemented function in comctl32.dll that prevented CPRS from running.*

The first thing is that you need to go into Fileman, and find
out what the version of CPRS you need to use is:

.. raw:: html
    
    <div class="code"><code>><strong>S DUZ=1 D Q^DI</strong>


    VA Fileman 22.2


    Select OPTION: <strong>INQUIRE TO FILE ENTRIES</strong>  



    Output from what File: <strong>19</strong>  OPTION         (10351 entries)
    Select OPTION NAME: <strong>OR CPRS GUI CHART</strong>       CPRSChart version 1.0.30.75
    Another one: <strong>^</strong></code></div>

Okay. So we need ``1.0.30.75``. So we navigate here: http://foia-vista.osehra.org/Patches_By_Application/CPRS%20GUI%20FILES/,
and from there, try to guess which version we need. From my version string, it looks like we need version 30. There are three
version 30's; so I guess I should choose the latest one.

At this point, we need to look for a .zip file. Looking through the list, I see

* OR_30_423_scrubbed.zip
* OR_30_423_SRC_scrubbed.zip

The one most likely to contain the CPRS exe is OR_30_423_scrubbed.zip;
SRC_scrubbed.zip is the CPRS source code, which also may contain a compiled
version.

*Please please note that this is what I see when I write this at the end of
2016; what you see in the future will certainly be different.*

So I download OR_30_423_scrubbed.zip, and open it. There is a CPRSChart.exe in
that one. But what version?

We can find that out by right clicking on the exe, choosing properties, and
then choosing the 4th tab. Over there, you will see the version number. Make
sure that that's the right version number compared with what you have.

  .. figure::
     images/InitializeVistA/right_click_on_cprs.png
     :align: center
     :alt: Right Click on CPRS

  .. figure::
     images/InitializeVistA/CPRSPropertiestab0.png
     :align: center
     :alt: First Tab

  .. figure::
     images/InitializeVistA/CPRSPropertiestab3.png
     :align: center
     :alt: Fourth Tab

If you have the right version, we can try running it, but you will get an 
error right away saying that 'borlndmm.dll' is needed.

You can find 'borlndmm.dll' in the source code download referenced above (the
zip file that contains SRC in the name) in the CPRS-Chart folder. Copy that file to the folder
where the CPRSChart.exe is located at.

Now, try to run CPRS again. You will get this splash screen:

  .. figure::
     images/InitializeVistA/CPRS_Splash_Screen.png
     :align: center
     :alt: Splash Screen

and the "ConnectTo" dialog:

  .. figure::
     images/InitializeVistA/CPRSConnectTo.png
     :align: center
     :alt: Connect To

Click on "New" and fill it in with the ip address of the server and the port number the RPC listener is listening at:

  .. figure::
     images/InitializeVistA/CPRSAddServer.png
     :align: center
     :alt: Add Server

Now, after you click ok, you will see this:

  .. figure::
     images/InitializeVistA/CPRSConnectTo2.png
     :align: center
     :alt: Connect To

Click OK. You will see that CPRS connects, and display the access and verify screen:

  .. figure::
     images/InitializeVistA/VISTASign-on.png
     :align: center
     :alt: Sign On

Now, put in the access and verify codes. If you followed along, this would be CPRS1234 and USR.1234.

Once you sign-in, since you are signing in for the first time, you will be asked to change your verify code:

  .. figure::
     images/InitializeVistA/CVC.png
     :align: center
     :alt: Sign On

Go ahead and change it (no screen shot shown) and then click OK. It will
confirm that it changed, and then you will see the patient selection screen.

  .. figure::
     images/InitializeVistA/CPRSPatientSelection.png
     :align: center
     :alt: Patient Selection

You should be happy when you reach this point; except that a medical records
system is useless without patients.

Registering your First Patient
------------------------------
Let's register a patient. Login using the CPRS User we just set-up.

    NB: On GT.M/YottaDB, patient registration will crash, as it tries to use Cache Specific Code.
    If you want to register the patient on GT.M/YottaDB, change entry point PATIENT^MPIFXMLP to
    ZPATIENT; and change line 25 of DGRPD, to remove the errant space:
    
    ``N DGSKIP S DGSKIP=$S(DGFORGN:"!,?42,""From/To: """,1:"?42, ""From/To: """)``

    to

    ``N DGSKIP S DGSKIP=$S(DGFORGN:"!,?42,""From/To: """,1:"?42,""From/To: """)``

    Make sure to exit GT.M/YottaDB using HALT or Ctrl-D so that the changes will "take".
    (There are smarter ways of doing this, but this is the easiest for beginners.)

Now, if you run CPRS again, you will see a patient, and you can select them:

  .. figure::
     images/InitializeVistA/CPRSPatientSelection2.png
     :align: center
     :alt: Patient Selection

and then you will see the cover sheet:

  .. figure::
     images/InitializeVistA/CPRSCoverSheet.png
     :align: center
     :alt: Cover Sheet

There is little you can do because most of VistA is not set-up. But you can now get
an idea of what CPRS is like. The most important step is to at least create one clinic.
You can do that in the SDBUILD menu. Doing this will unlock most of CPRS for you.

Next Steps
----------
* Set-up MAS Parameters
* Set-up Wards and Beds
* Set-up Clinics
* Install a Drug File, or create one from Scratch
* Set-up Outpatient Pharmacy
* Set-up Inpatient Pharmacy
* Set-up Lab Package for Chemistry and Hematology

Stopping VistA
--------------
To stop Taskman, use ``D STOP^ZTMKU`` and answer ``YES`` to stopping the submanagers.

To stop Broker, use ``D STOP^XWBTCP(<port no>)``.

To stop mailman, use ``D STOP^XMKPL`` and answer ``YES`` to stop it.
