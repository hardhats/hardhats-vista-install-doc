<p>If you have reached this point, it means that you have finished <a href="./SetMasParameters.html">MAS Parameter Set-up</a>.</p>
<p>If you have been following along, we now have three steps left.</p>
<ul>
<li>Create the Wards</li>
<li>Create the Rooms and Beds</li>
<li>Initailize the Gains and Losses System</li>
</ul>
<h1 id="create-wards">Create Wards</h1>
<p>We are going to create two wards to correspond to the two treating specialties we setup in the previous section: 3 West for Cardiology; 3 East for Dermatology.</p>
<p>Important fields:</p>
<ul>
<li>G&amp;L ORDER must be filled; otherwise ADT will crash.</li>
<li>HOSPITAL LOCATION FILE POINTER is silly in that you have to type the same exact entry again to add it to the hospital location file. Don't put a different entry name.</li>
<li>RAI/MDS WARD must be left blank. Filling this will also cause a crash.</li>
<li>The Totals field is saying &quot;count the number of patients here and put them in this category&quot;. You can repeat the category in another ward, and from that get a total number of admitted patients within a certain category. The example below shows a total of &quot;Hospital&quot; which will count the totals for the hospital (both wards together). There is a total of Cardiology and a total for Dermatology.</li>
</ul>
<p>From the same <code>ADT System Definition</code> menu, we will pick <code>Ward Definition Entry/Edit</code>.</p>

<p>In VistA, Rooms and Beds are a single entity. In reality, they should just be called &quot;Beds&quot;. A room with 3 beds may be labeled as 101-A, 101-B, and 101-C. You may add other characters to help you designate the bed as Male/Female, Luxury vs Shared, etc.</p>
<p>Here we create 3 rooms in each ward. 2 of the rooms have 2 beds each; one has a single bed for a total of 10 beds.</p>
