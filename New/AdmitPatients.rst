If you have reached this point, it means that you have finished `setting up the
wards <./WardSetup.html>`_.

This is the last step for configuring a hospital. We will admit two patients to
cardiology, and one patient to dermatology; and then show the display in CPRS.
We will also show the printout of the Gains and Losses report tomorrow after the
task we scheduled runs overnight.

We can register patients at the same time as admitting them; so that simplifies
things somewhat.
